"""
Keep in mind this project also contains the extra challenges from the site, link in the README file.
We create 3 variables that store data inputted from the user the first one being a random integer where it checks if
the number is an even or odd number and prints the appropiate message,the second and third variable will be used for
checking if the second variable can be divided by the third variable and print an appropiate message.
"""

# the conditions to check if the first number is odd/even and if the second number can be divided by the third number
# for that we use the modulo operator to see if it can be divided exactly to that integer.

if randint % 4 == 0:
    print("the first number can be divided by 4")

# here is a nested if so we can put some more conditions in each outcome for the second and third variable to print the
# appropiate message
