"""

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether
they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first
exercise

Extras:

Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
